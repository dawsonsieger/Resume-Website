                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>I’m Dawson Sieger, an Accessibility Specialist passionate about creating inclusive digital
                    experiences.
                    With
                    deep expertise in screen reader testing and WCAG audits, I help organizations build web and mobile
                    content
                    that truly works for everyone.</p>
                <h2 id="drive">Driven by Access, Grounded in Impact</h2>
                <p>I believe accessibility is about more than compliance — it's about dignity, independence, and
                    opportunity.
                </p>

                <p>One experience that continues to shape my work involved a blind law student who was falling behind
                    academically. His materials were mostly accessible, but he lacked the training to navigate them
                    effectively.
                    His university recognized the gap and reached out to me — not because they were required to, but
                    because
                    they believed in his potential.</p>

                <p>I worked closely with the student through one-on-one training, helping him master the tools he needed
                    to
                    succeed. At the same time, I partnered with the university to identify and remediate inaccessible
                    documents
                    and assignments, ensuring better access for others down the line.</p>

                <p>That experience reminded me of what really drives me: empowering individuals while helping
                    institutions
                    rise
                    to the moment. Because accessibility isn’t just about checking boxes — it’s about creating the
                    conditions
                    for people to thrive.</p>

                <h2 id="personal">Audits, Accessibility... and a Cat</h2>
                <p><em>(...plus another cat, and two very opinionated dogs.)</em></p>
                <p>When I’m not deep in WCAG audits or training someone on screen reader navigation, I’m usually
                    spending time with my fiancé and four pets — two dogs and two cats — who keep things lively (and
                    occasionally
                    chaotic).</p>
                <p>I’m also an avid gamer. Whether I’m exploring immersive story-driven worlds or thinking about
                    accessibility in game menus, I love how interactive media brings people together — when designed
                    right.</p>
                <p>I believe that accessibility work is ultimately about people. And having time for joy, curiosity, and
                    connection off-screen is just as important as getting the code right.</p>
